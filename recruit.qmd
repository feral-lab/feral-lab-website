## Graduate Opportunities

Curious about grad school? Interested in a master's or PhD in natural resources, environment or earth science? UAF's got great programs in all, and if there's not currently a position in the lab, happy to work together to apply for funding through programs like the [NSF GRFP](https://www.nsfgrfp.org/) and others.

## Postdoc Researchers

Interested in a postdoc? Please [email me](khayes23@alaska.edu) to discuss potential projects. I'm happy to talk about, develop and collaborate on proposals for independent funding like [NSF's Postdoctoral Research Fellowships](http://nsf.gov/funding/postdocs), the USDA-NIFA or others.
