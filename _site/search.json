    "text": "Interested in joining the lab? Open positions, if available, will be posted below:\n\nThe Forest Ecosystem Research Applications Lab at the University of Alaska Fairbanks invites applications for a Postdoc or Data scientist interested in applying process-based simulation modeling to management and climate adaptation issues in the boreal forests of Interior Alaska. This position will contribute to an ongoing project, co-produced with managers, that identifies climate-smart opportunities for co-benefits of fire management. We seek a postdoc or data scientist who can calibrate and apply iLand, a forest and disturbance model, to test the efficacy and long-term outcomes of climate-smart fire management strategies. This position will involve working closely with a diverse group of research partners including the Alaska Climate Adaptation Science Center, the Alaska Fire Science Consortium and the US Fish and Wildlife Service. The postdoc will contribute to a growing lab group and will be welcomed into a vibrant and well-connected network of iLand users in North America and beyond.\nThis is a full time position, with benefits, for one-year. Additional years are possible, based on performance and funding. Start date is flexible: the position can begin in Summer or Fall of 2026, according to candidate’s availability. The position can be in-person, hybrid or remote - funds are available for travel and professional development.\nSpecific responsibilities will include:\n\nWork closely with project lead and collaborators to parameterize, test and apply iLand to simulate fire management strategies in boreal ecosystems under future climate.\nProcess, synthesize, interpret and visualize model outputs, communicating results in oral presentations and through peer-reviewed journal articles.\nPresent results to research partners, through webinars, management meetings and internal team meetings.\n\nApplicants must have completed a Ph.D. in forest ecology, disturbance ecology, ecosystem modeling or some similar field prior to appointment. The ideal candidate will have advanced computational and programming skills, experience publishing peer-reviewed manuscripts and a demonstrated record of seeing projects through from start to finish. Experience in the following areas will be preferred: process-based simulation modeling, boreal forest ecosystem dynamics, fire ecology, research co-production. Priority will be given for excellent verbal and written skills and the interest and ability to interface with a diverse group of research partners. Most successful candidates do not meet all qualifications! If you have some of these skills, please consider applying.\nQuestions? Want more information? Please contact Kate Hayes (khayes23@alaska.edu).\nTo apply, please send your cover letter addressing your experience and qualifications in relation to the responsibilities of this position, a curriculum vitae, and contact information for three references to Kate Hayes (khayes23@alaska.edu). The position will remain open until filled.\n\nAs a lab, we aspire to create a diverse community that welcomes people of different races, cultures, ages, genders, sexuality, religions, socioeconomic levels, political perspectives, abilities, opinions, values and experiences."

Yet, momentum, support, and interest in strategic fire suppression as a mechanism for conserving boreal carbon is growing. It’s unclear whether suppression practices would maintain carbon over the next century of warming. Decision-makers urgently require precise information on the effectiveness of management strategies across the boreal.",
